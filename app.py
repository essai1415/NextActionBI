        "‚ú¶ In our data, 835 items had Making Charges above ‚Çπ50,000. By introducing a Good, Better, & Best choice with ‚Çπ3.0L with ‚Çπ52k MC, ‚Çπ3.3L with ‚Çπ65k MC and ‚Çπ4.0L with ‚Çπ85k MC, customers are naturally nudged toward the middle or premium option. Even if 30% move to ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù and 10% to ‚ÄúBest,‚Äù this simple decoy pricing approach can unlock nearly ‚Çπ50L additional revenue without increasing discounts, purely by guiding customers toward designs with higher Making Charges.",

That‚Äôs nearly 2/3 of all our sales. This means even a small adjustment in how we manage discounts here by just 2‚Äì3% can have the biggest impact on our overall margins. So, this segment needs careful control on discounts, supported by value added offers like vouchers.",
        "‚ú¶ For discounts above ‚Çπ50,000, we can split it. For example we can give ‚Çπ30,000 off now + ‚Çπ20,000 shopping voucher for the next purchase. In past data, 371 bills had discounts over ‚Çπ50,000. If part of it is a voucher, customers must come back, which boosts future sales and reduces instant profit loss."

        "‚ú¶ MIA ‚Äì ‚Çπ5.1 Cr sales from 1652 orders with an average discount of just ‚Çπ2.5k shows that customers like the brand at mid-level pricing. But with 68 returns, there‚Äôs a gap between what customers expect and what they actually receive. To fix this, MIA should improve product descriptions, images, and try-on/AR options so buyers feel more confident before purchasing, which will reduce returns and increase trust.",
